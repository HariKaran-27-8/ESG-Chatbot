Yes, the company has a clear policy for handling, recycling, or refurbishing electronic waste.

Additionally, their governance framework includes:

Question: What percentage of women are in leadership roles?
Answer:

 **wipro-esg-25.pdf**

According to the provided information, in the "Employee Categorization" section, Senior roles are categorized as leadership roles. The percentage of women in Senior (leadership) roles is 0.4%.

However, a more direct answer can be found in the "Employee Categorization" section under "Gender-wise FY25 %". The percentage of the total workforce that are Senior roles (leadership roles) is 0.4%, and the percentage of women in Senior roles is 0.4% as well.

To find the percentage of women in leadership roles, we need to calculate the percentage of women in the total workforce who are in Senior roles. However, since the Senior role is very small compared to the total workforce, and the percentage of women in Senior roles is also very small, the percentage of women in leadership roles is approximately 0.4% of 37.1% (the percentage of women in the total workforce). 

This can be calculated as 0.4 * 37.1 = 14.44%.

I don't have the specific information on the percentage of women in leadership roles at Infosys. The provided text mentions various initiatives and statistics, but it doesn't explicitly state the current percentage of women in leadership roles.

 **tcs-esg.pdf**

Based on the information provided, we can see the following percentages of women in leadership roles:

- Board of Directors: 25% (2 out of 8)
- Key Management Personnel: 0% (0 out of 3)

However, since the question is asking for the overall percentage of women in leadership roles, we need to calculate the total number of women in leadership roles out of the total number of leadership roles.

Since the information provided does not specify the total number of leadership roles, we can only provide the percentages of women in specific leadership roles.

To get the overall percentage of women in leadership roles, we would need more information about the total number of leadership roles in the company.
